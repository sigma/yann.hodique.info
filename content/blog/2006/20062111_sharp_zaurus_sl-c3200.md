Here it is, I have finally received this gorgeous piece of hardware : a Zaurus :)

{{< figure src="/media/blog/2006/zaurus_c3200.jpg" alt="Zaurus C3200" class="right" >}}

Better a picture than a long talk, here is the beast. This model can be found
only in Japan, so I had to import it via Ebay. Rather expensive, but very
powerful and running Linux from the beginning. Priceless !  When I first made
it boot, I was a bit puzzled to see all those Japanese characters and no
trivial option to switch to English. In addition it was the evening and I had
nothing for dealing with the Japanese plug. So that it went down during
the night.

After purchasing a universal plug I decided to flash it with a ROM that was
recommended to me : pdaXrom. I don't know what has gone wrong, but 10 minutes
later I had in my hand a beautiful but useless device : even the battery LED
refused to light **very** wrong.  "Stress" would not describe the situation too
well :-)

For some reason, the service menu had gone too, so that booting while holding
D + M was no option. After stressing Google with my repeated "zaurus bricked"
searches, I found out that there were actually a second minimalistic ROM
available !  "Happiness" would not describe the situation too well ;-). So, in
case someone needs it : here is the magical combo that will save your life,
your soul, and even your zaurus : `Fn + D + M`.  Yeah !

Actually it seems that you can't destroy your Zaurus (at least the 3*00) by
flashing it. Still, don't blame me if you succeed
