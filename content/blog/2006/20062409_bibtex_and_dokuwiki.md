Updating my bibliography page, I realize I should spend some time releasing
a clean version of my Bibtexref plugin for DokuWiki.  Its life has begun as
a simple adaptation of
[PmWiki's version](http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/BibtexRef), that we
wrote with a few friends of mine ([Gnurou](http://gnurou.org) and
[Mickey](http://www.lifl.fr/~hauspie)), at the time I was still using that
Wiki engine.

But this fork has lived its life since then, and now the codebase is pretty
different and unreleased, which is Bad.

In addition, there are still a few bugs and misfeatures I'd like to fix.
