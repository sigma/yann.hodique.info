It looks like [DVC](http://www.xsteve.at/prg/emacs_dvc/dvc.html) has a great
potential for managing several kinds of branches within Emacs.  I've used it in
the past when it was named Xtla and I was hacking on
[Muse](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsMuse) and
[Planner](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode) which are managed
by [Arch](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/).

Now I would love to have this great interface play nicely with my
[Bzr](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) (mostly) and [Darcs](http://www.darcs.net/)
(marginally). Basic support is provided, but still I miss the browsing and
partner facilities, and also the cherry-picking interface.

I've checked out all this, will have a couple of days to study the code, and
I hope I'll be able to contribute after that.
