It seems there are still people out there that are coming to my site (or even
my mailbox :)) due to my
[Dokuwiki plugin for BibTeX entries]({{< ref "projects/bibtex_plugin.md" >}}).
While I'm always happy to help, I recognise the current situation (with the
code living as a zipfile here) is not very practical.  Moreover, since I'm no
longer in Academia, my involvement with this plugin is totally
minimal. Actually I just verify it still works each time I upgrade my Dokuwiki
install, which I just did.

So I just put the code, mostly as-is, in
a [new GitHub project](https://github.com/sigma/dw-bibtex). This way, if
somebody is interested in taking over, or simply in providing patches, they're
welcome to do so !

No doubt there's much to rework/cleanup there
