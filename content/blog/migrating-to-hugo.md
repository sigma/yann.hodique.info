It's been a long while (more than 3 years !) since I haven't written anything
here. Partly it's because I'm busy as hell (and love it !), and partly it's
because interacting with my old website wasn't fun anymore.

Dokuwiki is a great platform, really, but I just don't want to care about all
this anymore. What I want is to write and publish from my Emacs. I also want
static webpages so I don't have to even think about security.

I've been playing for a while with various generators, mainly written in
python. But now it's all over cause I've discovered [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
It's so fast and flexible that it's not even funny...  So today I went shopping
for a nice theme, found
a [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-the-program) I liked
(yes, I'm still very much into console-looking stuff), ported it to Hugo and
worked on a Dokuwiki to Markdown converter (very primitive stuff, just enough
to get me through 90% of the conversion, and I did the remaining 10% manually).

And... voil√†. Feels good
