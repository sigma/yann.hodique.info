I'm a daily user of GNU Emacs, and hack a lot on it and with it !

Here are a couple of contributions you might be interested in:

*  My **huge** configuration suite:
   [http://github.com/sigma/dotfiles](http://github.com/sigma/dotfiles)
   including a large emacs part
* [A Org-mode addon to generate S5 slides]({{< relref "blog/2009/11/14/s5_presentation_from_org-mode.md" >}})
* [A Magit branch to support extensibility]({{< relref "blog/2010/02/14/magit_extensions.md" >}})
  (now integrated upstream)
