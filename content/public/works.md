## Thesis Work

I'm interested in specification and verification of various non-functional
properties for open embedded operating systems.  More precisely, I'm working on
the CAMILLE operating system (in collaboration with the RD2P team) and trying
to perform some static analysis on the bytecode to ensure the validity of some
properties, mostly related to security and optimization. See my
[thesis subject]({{< relref "subject.md" >}}) (in french) for
more informations.
